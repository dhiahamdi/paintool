welcome to Paintool ^^ 
paintool is a paint tool , the first step to start using it is by  uploading images to use them as background to draw on .
after setting the background you can draw shapes (rectangle, cercle, triangle...) with the ability of modifying the color , opacity and thikness of the shapes . also when switching from views the modifications remains .

Timing:
5 hours to learn about vue + [5 ~ 6] hours of work !
